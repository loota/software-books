# Good to Great

_Jim C. Collins_

- Stockdale's paradox: in harsh situations optimists don't survive. It's better to except the worst but hope for the best.

- Hedgehog Concept: The important thing is to understand where a company can excel. It is not strategy, not mission, not values, not vision. 

- First who, then what. Find good people and then rotate the positions of them in the company.

- The Flywheel: small things add up.
