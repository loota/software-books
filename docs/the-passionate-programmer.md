# The Passionate Programmer

_Chad Fowler_

- Consider technologies as investments. High-risk, high reward and low-risk, low reward.

- Be the worst one in the team. That way you'll learn.

- Be mentored and mentor someone.

- Your manager's successes are your successes, possibly the only ones.

- Be where you're at. Work well at your current job instead of only fantasizing about the future.

- Socialize with the business people.
