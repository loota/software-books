# Principles of Software Engineering Management

_Tom Gilb_

- Impact estimation table: a simple table with a solution, a consequence and a probability.

- Thinking tools, not dogma.

- Measuring even things that are hard to measure is possible. Likability: percentage of users after six weeks who will say in anonymous survey that they prefer it to the old one.

- Also, instructions for incremental software development almost two decades before the Agile Manifesto was written.
