_Steve McConnell_

- Manage complexity. Avoid complex solutions.

- Do not optimize until you are sure of it. There is a whole chapter about not optimizing.

- Productivity studies have found that even almost 100 lines long functions are as productive to maintain as shorter ones.

- Assertions can also be used for postconditions or even in the middle of routines.

- Possibly the biggest benefit of not using goto is the avoidance of useless discussions.

- Psychological distance of words can be subtle but very harmful.
