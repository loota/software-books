# Becoming a Technical Leader

_Gerald Weinberg_

- Manage the flow of ideas, motivate, organize.

- Define the problems.

- Control the quality.

- Create an environment where problems get solved instead of solving them yourself.

- NPS, No Problem Syndrome: inability to accept that any problem is hard. 

- People with strong technical backgrounds can turn any task into a technical one, thus avoiding the work that needs to be done.
